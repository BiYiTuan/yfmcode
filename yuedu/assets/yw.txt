ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 

The completion of this book has left me with the challenge of expressing my gratitude for the acts of 
encouragement and support offered by so many people. My indebtedness goes far beyond a thank you. 
To those who contributed, directly or otherwise, I offer my deepest appreciation. 

The following individuals are deserving of a special thank you. 

Les Hewitt: My mentor who said, "You need to write a book," and then inspired me to follow through on 
his idea. Thank you for your undying confidence and support. We just did it! 

Shauna Dobrowolski: My executive assistant for over four years！what an outstanding woman. 
Shauna is the epitome of the human side of business. Her positive attitude is the envy of her peers, and 
her unwavering support, dedication and enthusiasm formed the cornerstone of this project. 

Rod Chapman: My editor who used more red ink than a tax auditor while assuring me it was in the 
interest of, "stylistic consistency, parallel construction, and a clean manuscript." We are still talking! 

Gary Lundgren: His awesome cartoons relate to us all. Thanks for "Bernie."

Preface 

Now I know what it's like to give birth, at least in the conceptual sense. Although the gestation period of 
this book was longer than childbirth, its development parallels the emotions and activities of an 
expectant mother: mood swings, impatience, anxiety, cravings, anticipation, check-ups, having to 
choose a name, and the frustration of several missed due dates. 

I spent months organizing my thoughts before finally putting ideas on paper and into my tape recorder. 
When I saw the Table of Contents and the Introduction taking shape, it was like feeling the first kick. I 
was filled with excitement and an overwhelming sense of trepidation. This could have been my first bout 
of morning sickness！at least it felt that way. I would wake up thinking, "What did I get myself into? 
Can I really write a book that salespeople will actually read?" 

It appears we've done that. I say "we" because this delivery is the result of a synergistic effort by many 
individuals. The birth of anything is rarely a solo performance. 
10 Steps to Sales Success represents my deepest belief that selling is fun. Selling is one of the most 
challenging yet rewarding careers in our society. Sales entrepreneurs are emerging as one of the most 
sophisticated and important players in the business arena. A sales career offers no end of promise, and 
the excitement of endless possibilities. Selling is a springboard to the fulfilment of all your goals and 
aspirations. It's my hope that this book will help you and others discover (or perhaps rediscover) the 
joys of professional selling, and that it will empower you to truly aspire to new levels of success. Life 
validates that success is a matter of choice, not chance. Enjoy.

Introduction！Why This Book? 

As a professional sales trainer, I have discovered a very important aspect of adult learning: people love 
simplicity. The simpler the better. I wrote this book with that goal in mind; to reveal the simplicity of 
selling. Selling is simple. Simple is fun. That is why the KISS principle (Keep It Simple Salespeople) 
prevails. This book offers an approach that strips away the perceived complexities of selling and 
discusses selling in its purest form: a dialogue between two human beings. 
The required skills of an effective sales professional have become increasingly sophisticated. Today's 
customers are looking for a whole range of products and services to meet their business and personal 
needs. Customers have become immune to traditional sales techniques. Technological changes, sales 
automation, deregulation, and the global economy have blurred many product distinctions, at the same 
time stimulating a highly competitive selling environment. Nowadays, product and price alone will not 
sustain a competitive edge. We have seen the demise of the "obvious product solution." Your product 
on its own will no longer stimulate a sale. Your customers can buy virtually the same product at the 
same price elsewhere, so why should they buy from you? Customers appreciate a salesperson with 
empathy！the ability to develop a total solution versus simply presenting a product. They also 
appreciate the efficiency of new technologies, high tech, but still want the warmth of the human aspect, 
high touch. 

Sales productivity often gets sabotaged by the mechanics of selling. Unfortunately in many cases, 
selling becomes more of a strategic engagement with the enemy rather than a conversation with a 
potential ally to your business. 

You are about to learn powerful proven techniques of professional selling. As you master the techniques 
revealed in this book, you too will experience new levels of productivity. Expect your close ratio 
(successful sales to number of sales calls) to double. No longer will you have to worry about missing 
your monthly or quarterly sales targets. 
If you are like me, the visual aspect represents an important part of adult learning. Research suggests 
that most of the information stored in people's minds enters through their eyes. If your words conflict 
with your actions, a listener will believe the actions. I have taken my 25 years of practical sales 
experience and designed a visual representation of what the entire sales process looks like. I am not 
aware of any other book that presents the entire selling process in visual form.

matter covered. It is sold with the understanding that the publisher is not engaged in rendering legal, 
accounting, or other professional service. If legal advice or other expert assistance is required, the
